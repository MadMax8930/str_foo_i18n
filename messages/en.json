     "primary": "Create a High-End Custom Banner for Your Street Food Business\n\nAre you looking to make your street food business stand out and attract more customers? Lucky you! I specialize in high-end custom banner designs tailored for food trucks/stands that make a lasting impact. With a focus on professional design, I combine all elements—photos of food, logo, promotional text, prices, and any details you want—into a cohesive and eye-catching design that draws in customers.\n\nHere’s how the process works:\n\n1. Initial Consultation & Measurements:\n   I’ll visit your food truck/stand in person to take accurate measurements of the space where the banner will be placed. This ensures a perfect fit and makes the design look polished and professional. During this visit, we will discuss your vision for the banner, including any specific photos of food, text, logos, or other details you'd like included.\n\n2. Custom Banner Design:\n   After gathering all necessary information, I’ll create a high-end custom design that aligns with your business’s branding and goals. The design will include vibrant food images, promotional text, prices, and any other content that reflects your business. The goal is to create a banner that attracts customers and enhances the visibility of your business.\n\n3. Review the Design & Payment:\n   The next day, I will return to show you the completed design. I’ll walk you through the design, ensuring it meets your expectations.\n   If you’re satisfied, I will take payment on the spot. The price for this service is **1000 Baht**. This includes a full day of work, taking measurements, the design process, and delivery of the final files.\n   No payment is required if you’re not satisfied with the design! I will spend an entire day working on your banner design, but if you don’t like the final result, you won’t have to pay a single cent. This means you have no financial risk—I’m confident you’ll love the design, but if not, there’s no obligation to pay.\n\n4. Final Delivery & Export Files:\n   Once you approve the design and payment is received, I will send you the final design files right away to your provided email. These files are optimized for different uses:\n   - **PDF**: A high-resolution file, carefully crafted with precise measurements, perfect for printing. The PDF ensures that the banner will print without any issues, retaining the professional look.\n   - **PNG/JPG**: These file formats are great for online use, such as social media, website display, or digital marketing materials.\n   - **SVG (Vector)**: A scalable vector file format, which means the design can be resized without any loss of quality—ideal for future use in different sizes, from small print to large signage. Vectors are great for scaling your design without losing image sharpness.\n\n5. Printing & Application:\n   Once you’ve received the files, you are free to handle the printing yourself. You can take the files to any printing company of your choice (or I can recommend options if needed). I do not provide printing services myself, but I ensure the files are print-ready and meet all quality standards.\n\nWhy Choose Me?\n- I focus on high-end custom designs that make your food business stand out.\n- **No-risk guarantee**: If you don’t like the design, there’s no charge.\n- **Fast service**: I take measurements, complete the design, and deliver the files all in one day.\n- You’ll receive the design in multiple formats (PDF, PNG/JPG, SVG) tailored for both print and digital uses.\n\nAt the bottom of this page, you can check out my previous work and feel free to contact me if you're interested in getting started."
